[Five Things Strategy Isn’t](http://ssir.org/articles/entry/five_things_strategy_isnt)

Strategy isn't strategy...

- When it’s fixed.
- When it’s insulated.
- When it doesn’t consider people.
- When it’s old, hidden, or boring.
- When we are too attached to it.

[The Strategic Plan is Dead. Long Live Strategy.](http://ssir.org/articles/entry/the_strategic_plan_is_dead._long_live_strategy)

To provide structure to this fluid approach, we focus on answering a series of four interrelated questions about the organization’s strategic direction:

- what vision you want to pursue,
- how you will make a difference,
- how you will succeed,
- and what capabilities it will take to get there.
