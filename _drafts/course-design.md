How to Make Assignments more Authentic

1. Design around Problems and Frame Using GRASPS (goal, role, audience, situation, product, standards), as in an imperfect recent example.
2. Find a Real Audience, online or in person.
3. Peer Review and Response (demonstrated examples using Google Docs and Poll Everywhere)

Performance Assessment: GRASPS

When constructing performance assessment tasks, it helps to use the acronym GRASPS:

**G** Real-world Goal
**R** Real-world Role
**A** Real-world Audience
**S** Real-world Situation
**P** Real-world Products or Performances
**S** Standards

GOAL
Provide a statement of the task. Establish the goal, problem, challenge, or obstacle in the task.

ROLE
Define the role of the students in the task. State the job of the students for the task.

AUDIENCE
Identify the target audience within the context of the scenario. Example audiences might include a client or committee.

SITUATION
Set the context of the scenario. Explain the situation.

PRODUCT
Clarify what the students will create and why they will create it.

STANDARDS and CRITERIA (INDICATORS)
Provide students with a clear picture of success. Identify specific standards for success. Issue rubrics to the students or develop them with the students

[30 Ideas for Teaching Writing](http://www.nwp.org/cs/public/print/resource/922)

- **Talk your paper** Tell a friend what your paper is about. Pay attention to your explanation. Are all of the ideas you describe actually in the paper? Where did you start in explaining your ideas. Does your paper match your description? Can the listener easily find all of the ideas you mention in your description?
- **Ask someone to read your paper out loud to you** Ask a friend to read your draft out loud to you. What do you hear? Where does your reader stumble? Sound confused? Have questions? Did your reader ever get lost in your text? Did ideas flow in the order the reader expected them to? Was anything missing for the reader? Did the reader need more information at any point?


# Research Activity: How old is this place?

One common research task is finding sources that can help determine the age of a building. Maps, deed research, and newspapers can all be helpful be helpful in finding this date. Sources can be used to determine:

- **an exact date**—dedicated on April 1, 1910
- **a date range**—erected between 1905 and 1915
- **a benchmark (?) date** —erected _by_ 1915 or erected _before_ 1915

The age of a building or other historic places can also be expressed in relationship to other **events**, **places** or **people**. For example, a building erected in….

- **1969** was built the same year as the [first moon landing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11)
- **1921** was built the same year [Mayor William Donald Schaefer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Donald_Schaefer) was born
- **1895** was built the same year [Frederick Douglass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Douglass) died

Events can also be used to position source in a sequence. For example, a building erected in 1910 was built…

- **After** the [Great Baltimore Fire of 1904](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Baltimore_Fire)
	- **Around** the same time as the race riots following [Jack Johnson’s boxing match](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Johnson_(boxer))
	- **Before** [World War One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I) began in 1914

In this activity, we combine two challenges:

- finding and evaluating sources
- placing sources in the context of local events 

Find sources using the Baltimore Heritage directory of [Digital Sources for Local History Research](http://baltimoreheritage.org/resources/digital-sources-for-local-history-research/).

**Note**: It may be helpful to have a tip sheet or suggestions for working with Google Books, ProQuest Historical Newspapers or other common database search tools.

This activity uses [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/) and [Timeline JS](http://timeline.knightlab.com/).

## Part 1: Finding and listening to sources

1. Select a place that you are interested in learning more about. It can be a building, 
2. Locate four sources that you think will help you to determine the age of the building. For example, you could find two maps, a city directory, and a newspaper advertisement.
3. Write a brief description of what each source tells you about the age of the building. Ask yourself:
	- Do you trust what your source is telling you? If not, why not?
	- How many sources do you need to determine a benchmark date? A date range? An exact date?
4. Add your sources to the [research challenge spreadsheet timeline](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O0etcOMbaX6jQXsjrg-7lEBCsWb9KRNSDDDC5gbvlDE/edit?usp=sharing). Make sure to add a link to an image of your source in the “Media” column of the spreadsheet. Take a [look at the timeline](http://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline3/latest/embed/index.html?source=1O0etcOMbaX6jQXsjrg-7lEBCsWb9KRNSDDDC5gbvlDE&font=OpenSans-GentiumBook&lang=en&initial_zoom=2&height=650) to explore your sources and sources contributed by other learners.

## Part 2: Placing sources in context

1. Using the age of the building **find three events** from Baltimore or Maryland history that took place **before**, **around the same time**, and **after** the date of construction. [Wikipedia’s List of years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_years) is helpful in identifying these events.
2. Add the date, titles and short descriptions for these events to the [research challenge timeline](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O0etcOMbaX6jQXsjrg-7lEBCsWb9KRNSDDDC5gbvlDE/edit?usp=sharing) in Google Sheets.
3. Why did you select the events that you did? How do they help you understand or explain the sources you found in part one of the activity?
3. Take a [look at the timeline](http://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline3/latest/embed/index.html?source=1O0etcOMbaX6jQXsjrg-7lEBCsWb9KRNSDDDC5gbvlDE&font=OpenSans-GentiumBook&lang=en&initial_zoom=2&height=650) to explore your sources and the events contributed by other learners.
