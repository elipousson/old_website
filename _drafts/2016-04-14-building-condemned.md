Last year, I started researching the history of vacant houses and demolition in Baltimore. When did Baltimore City first start tearing down vacant and abandoned buildings? How did the city come to have the legal authority to demolish private property? How has demolition contributed to the city’s housing policy past and present?

I incorporated bits and pieces of my research into a paper ([part 1](https://historicsprawl.wordpress.com/2015/05/12/we-have-a-problem-with-vacant-houses-in-baltimore-part-one-of-a-draft-paper-for-the-vaf-conference-in-chicago/) and [2](https://historicsprawl.wordpress.com/2015/05/12/we-have-a-problem-with-vacant-houses-in-baltimore-part-two-of-two/)) for the Vernacular Architecture Forum and a [bike tour](http://baltimoreheritage.github.io/tours/bike/2015/08/09/vacant-house-bike/). In this post, I’m sharing some additional material from my research on the early history of condemnation and demolition.

## Inspector of Buildings Edward D. Preston

In April 1900, the  _Sun_ published one of the earliest accounts of a condemnation  _A Building Condemned_

> Building Inspector Preston yesterday condemned as unsafe for use an old two-story brick dwelling on Sarah Ann street, west of Pine street. The house is tenanted. Mr. Preston found that beside being unsafe as to walls, it was without a chimney, stovepipes being let out through the side of the building to permit of the escape of smoke. He judges the building was once a stable and later converted into a dwelling at little expense.

A tragic story published in the _Sun_ on May 12, 1900, _THEIR HUMBLE HOME UNSAFE: Mr. And Mrs. Henry Unkelback Fear They May Be Turned Out_, states:

> Burned with the fear that they may be made homeless are an old couple who occupy the dwelling 907 West Saratoga street, which has been condemned as unsafe by Building Inspector Preston. The couple are Mr. and Mrs. Henry Unkelback and for more than 30 years they have lived in the house which they now fear they may be compelled to abandon.
> The house is two stories high and was probably built more than half a century ago.
> ...In better days Mr. Unkelback owned the little house. He became poorer as he grew older, and when he was unable to pay the taxes on the house it was sold by the city. Mr. Unkelback says he does not know who purchased the house, but had heard the purchaser was involved in a legal fight in the courts with the owner of the ground. He had hoped that he would be allowed undisputable possession of the house until after the lawsuit had been settled.
> Building Inspector Preston is determined, however, that the walls of the house must come down. If the owner of it declines to make the house secure the Building Inspector will likely have the work done and then sue the owner for the money.
