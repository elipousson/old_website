This is a follow up post to my post on [explaining Baltimore's vacant houses with data visualizations](http://elipousson.github.io/resources/2015/11/10/vacant-vernacular-data-visualization/). Maps may be considered a kind of data visualization but I felt they deserved a separate discussion. 

## What are my questions?

- Where are vacant houses located? Why there and not other places?
- How has the geography of vacant houses changed over time?

## What tools am I using?

- [geojson.io](http://geojson.io)
- Atom Package: [geojson-preview](https://atom.io/packages/geojson-preview)

## What am I reading?

... What is good on this topic? I'd love to do more research.
