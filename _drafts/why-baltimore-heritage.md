- A social movement?

- A profession?
- A set of values?

## Why do old places matter?

[Continuity](http://blog.preservationleadershipforum.org/2013/11/21/old-places-continuity/)

> With Heritage So Rich, the idea of continuity is captured in the phrase “sense of orientation,” the idea that preservation gives “...a sense of orientation to our society, using structures, and objects of the past to establish values of time and place.”

[Memory](http://blog.preservationleadershipforum.org/2013/12/04/old-places-matter-memory/)

> Yet architecture critic for The New York Times, Herbert Muschamp, wrote, “The essential feature of a landmark is not its design, but the place it holds in a city’s memory. Compared to the place it occupies in social history, a landmark’s artistic qualities are incidental." (The New York Times, January 8, 2006.)

[Individual Identity](http://blog.preservationleadershipforum.org/2014/01/08/old-places-matter-identity-1/)

> Yi-Fu Tuan, the influential geographer who pioneered the study of people’s relationship to place, wrote, “What can the past mean to us?  People look back for various reasons, but shared by all is the need to acquire a sense of self and of identity… The passion for preservation arises out of the need for tangible objects that can support a sense of identity…”

[Civic, State, National and Universal Identity](http://blog.preservationleadershipforum.org/2014/01/22/old-places-matter-identity-2-2/)

> Old places embody our ever-changing shared identities and serve as tangible sites for transforming identity. While we should guard against the dangers of nationalism, these old places, through the diversity of identities, reflect our universal humanity.

[Beauty](http://blog.preservationleadershipforum.org/2014/02/07/old-places-matter-beauty/#.Vs3Ze5MrKAw)

> “Where we find beauty varies, but we do agree that appreciating it is a deeply positive experience contributing to happiness and wellbeing. This fact alone is enough to justify taking beauty more seriously. And a proper understanding of what beauty is and the purposes it may serve will show why beauty should even be integral to planning and policy.” (Kieran, Matthew. The X factor: beauty in planning.  Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment, 2010.)

[History](http://blog.preservationleadershipforum.org/2014/02/21/old-places-matter-history/)

> The National Park Service website says, ‘Historic places have powerful and provocative stories to tell. As witnesses to the past, they recall the events that shaped history and the people who faced those situations and issues.”

[Architecture](http://blog.preservationleadershipforum.org/2014/05/23/old-places-matter-architecture/)

> We may not—we almost undoubtedly do not—know all the “spirit” embedded in old buildings. As the Finnish architect Juhani Pallasmaa wrote: “There is a tacit wisdom of architecture accumulated in history and tradition. But in today’s panicked rush for the new, we rarely stop to listen to this wisdom.” (Pallasmaa, 319.)
