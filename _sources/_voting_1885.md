The Voting Population of the City.-The police census of voters or Baltimore city for 1885 shows an increase over the enumeration of 1883 of about two thousand. The total voting population, including those who will attain their majority before the next registration, is 83,441, of whom 71,154 are white and 12,290 colored men. The actual registered vote of the city in October, 1831, was 77,007, of whom 65,184 were white and 11,823 colored. It will be seen, therefore, that the total registered vote is now within 6,437 of the possible registration, and that the names of colored voters on the books are within 467 of the enumeration, while the whites arc 5,970 below the police census. It is always the case that the colored voters register much nearer their full strength than the whites. The census is taken at the season of the year when a great many people are out of the city, and perhaps the proportion-of these is as great among the colored voters as among the whites, for a great many colored people find employment during the summer at the springs and other resorts where the white people go for recreation and pleasure. The interesting feature of the present enumeration is the showing it mofceg of the shifting of voters to the outlying territory, Indicating the drift of population to the suburbs, and the growth of the city towardB the restricted boundary in all directions. Indeed, it may be safely assumed that many hundreds, if not thousands, by this migration get over the boundary and become voters in the belt instead of in Baltimore Jltself. where all their interests and business lie. The wards which gain in voting population are as follows:

First, 55: fourth, 320; sixth, 057; seventh, 22; eighth, 211; twelfth, 404: thirteenth, 87; fourteenth. 147; seventeenth, 425; eighteenth, 499; Einoteenth, 420; twentieth, 4457 The wards which lose voters are the second. 156; third,«85; fifth, 133; ninth, 523; tenth, 69; eleventh, 243; fifteenth, 137; sixteenth, 343. The great bulk of the loss is in the eastern, southern and central wards, while in the north, northwest, west and southwest there is marked increase.
