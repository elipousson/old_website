2,565 CITY DWELLINGS FOUND TO BE VACANT

Recent Survey Shows 941 More Are Under Construction In Various Sections.

TOTAL OF 131,806 RECORDED

Owners Occupy 80,220, While 40,015 Are Used By Rent Payers.

The housing situation in Baltimore, while far from satisfactory, is not as acute as has been believed generally, according to a report made public yesterday at the offices of the Real Estate Board. The report shows 2,565 vacant dwellings and 941 in process of construction.

The report, which is the result of a survey of housing conditions in this city by members of the Police Department in co-operation with the Real Estate Board, shows that there are 131,806 dwellings in the city, 80,226 being occupied by the owners and 49,015 rented to others.

The district having the largest number of vacant dwellings is the Northwestern, with 663. The district with the lowest number is the Western, with 100. Of dwellings under construction the Northwestern district leads with 273, followed by the Northern with 221, the Southern with 123 and the Southwestern with 44. There are 280 dwellings linger construction in the Northeastern and Eastern districts, the greater number being in the Northeastern. None was reported as being built in the Western and Central districts.

**Variance In Total Doubted.**

While it is understood that some of the dwellings in an advanced stage of construction may have been included among the number reported by the police as vacant, it is believed that the total will not vary considerably from the figures quoted or a total of 3,506 dwellings.

Of rented dwellings the Northwestern has the largest number, with 12,013, the lowest number. 2,103, being in the Central district. The largest number of buildings other than homes is in the Central district, where there are 1,773.

The district having the largest number of dweUings occupied by owners is the Northwestern, with 20,823. The district with the lowest number is the Western, with 1,921.
