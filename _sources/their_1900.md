THEIR HUMBLE HOME UNSAFE

Mr. And Mrs. Henry Unkelback Fear They May Be Turned Out.

Burdened with the fear that they may be made homeless are an old couple who occupy the dwelling 907 West Saratoga street, which has been condemned as unsafe by Building Inspector Preston. The couple are Mr. and Mrs. Henry Unkelback, and for more than 30 years they have lived in the house which they now fear they may be compelled to abandon.

The house is two stories high and was probably built more than half a century ago. The front wall bulges out, the brick have become separated along a part of the lower story and the window frames are no longer intact. Paint long since disappeared from the window frames and door and many of the window panes are broken. Evidences of the direst poverty are everywhere visible in the interior of the bouse. A trunk, a few chairs and a broken bookcase comprise the entire furniture of the front room, the floor of which is bare of covering. The other rooms are likewise poorly furnished.

The old couple are poorly clad. Both talked yesterday in anxious though faltering tones of their condition, which, however, they seem to regard of less importance than being ejected from the house. The husband said he and his wife had suffered much during the winter months, although they had received some aid from the Charity Organization Society. He said he formerly vended coal for a livelihood, but now makes a little money selling fish. He looks very feeble, however, and seemingly would be unable to do any work which required much energy.

Mr. Unkelback is a native of Germany, while his wife was born in Ireland. Her maiden name was Catharine Dugeney. They have lived in Baltimore since their youth and were married more than 40 years ago. They have four daughters, all of whom are married. In better days Mr. Unkelback owned the little house. He became poorer as he grow older, and when he was unable to pay the taxes on the house it was sold by the city. Mr, Unkelbnek says he does not know who purchased the house, but had heard the purchaser was involved in a legal fight in the courts with the owner of the ground. He had hoped that he would be allowed undisputed possession of the house until after the lawsuit had been settled.

Building Inspector Preston is determined, however, that the walls of the house must come down. If the owner of it declines to make the house secure the Building Inspector will likely have the work done and then sue the owner for the money.
