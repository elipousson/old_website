Instead of wiping out the few beauty spots left in poor, dirty, neglected, old Baltimore, may I ask why do not the owners of some of the shabby vacant stores and dwellings within the "district bounded by Read, Paca, Pratt and Holliday streets" tear down the useless, unsightly buildings on which they are paying taxes, erect little white fences around their grounds and rent parking spaces?
