First of five-slum clearance low-rental housing projects in Baltimore [...] Harris Wrecking Company of Cleveland and Baltimore tearing down approximately 250 dwellings in the area bounded by Fremont avenue, Lexington, Amity and Saratoga streets. [...]

The first job to which the wrecking crews will be assigned will be the stripping of salvable electric and plumbing units from structures to which the Authority has obtained title.

There will be no tumbling or throwing of brick walls, as is customary in some razing jobs. Instead, the walls will be taken down with care so that the bricks may be used in the low-rental houses and not thrown on the second-hand market here.

Other materials become the property of the contractor.

The structures will be razed to the ground level only. The basement walls will be left intact.
