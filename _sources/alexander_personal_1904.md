OEK BATTLE F<>« liMBEKTY.

j Our Suffrage League-meeting held at Sharp Street Memorial Church, **d at Madison Street Presbyterian Church, have been gratifying and inspiring to the Boardiof Directors,ar.d I take this opportunity to urge our our people, to make all future meetings express our indignation against Jim Crowism.

The mectiing next wreck is booked torLeadcnhaH Street Babtist Church South Baltimore,.and we hope that the pastors in that section and ou: people generally throughout the city will see that the church n crowded.

Evidently, the enemies of the ram have it in their hearts tomake Many land the final, fighting ground -ci which their inhuman scheme is toib settled, and from which the sysbtn is to be applied! in all parts ofi'th United States,

In view of this fact, wc mtisfiabn tribute every means at our com mand to defeat their purpose. ',

It is also gratifying to knowihaj many good, white people ofi Haiti i more are heart and soul with us il I this fight for life, liberty and, th| j pursuit ofhappiness. Some of tbei [ have I spoken out through tb i press and others have.- expresse j their approval of our- protest b : their letters to the President of tt j League,	:■:>

We arc, also, especially indebte to both branches of the Friends A ! sociation, who sent a strong pm j test to the Legislature.

! While in this cosSict let us kno j that it is our duty, to support erei i business enterprise conducted by oi people. Let us, also, withhold oi support from white men whcvcari on business, ana who are inleag j with the. gang that is doing all;’' j heir power to- deprive us of oi I ivil and political right s.
