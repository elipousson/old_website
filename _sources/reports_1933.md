REPORTS ON SALES FOR UNPAID TAXES

City Collector Says 103 Pieces Of Properly Under Hammer Were Vacant

17 LISTED AS WRECKS

Only Three Disposed Of Last Week Were Occupied By Their Owners

An inspection of 206 properties sold at a tax sale last week disclosed that 105, or 50.9 per cent., were vacant and only three occupied by the owners, Thomas G. Young, City Collector, reported yesterday.

Facts relating to the other properties were given as follows: Rented, 77, or 37.3 per cent.; in fair condition, 100; in good condition, 35; in bad condition, 33.

Seventeen properties were reported as "wrecks."

The types of houses were: One story, 3; two stories, 136; two and a half stories, 19; three stories, 27.

**Property Inspected**

Tax-sale property was inspected for the first time following the sale. Mr. Young said his idea was to ascertain the character, location, occupancy and condition of the property on which persons had not paid their taxes and were willing to give up.

The properties were well scattered as to location, being in twenty-four of the city’s twenty-eight wards—from the First to the Twenty-fourth, inclusive.

"The report presents an interesting study," Mr. Young said, "and tends to show that in many cases the properties were bought for speculation—that when they could not be sold or rented the owners let them go for the taxes due."

**Properties Withdrawn**

But there was another side to the story, as Mr. Young gave it. He said that in the beginning 786 pieces of property were surveyed and listed for sale and the owners notified. Before the advertisement appeared the taxes on 231 properties, or 29.3 per cent., were paid in full and the properties withdrawn from the sale, leaving 555 to be advertised.

After the 555 were advertised, the taxes were paid on all but 37.1 per cent., or 206 properties—those actually sold—and they were withdrawn from the sale before the auctioneer placed them on the block.
