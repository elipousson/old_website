Hello! My name is Eli Pousson. I am a historic preservation advocate and local historian in Baltimore, Maryland. I work for [Baltimore Heritage](http://baltimoreheritage.org), occasionally blog at [Historic Sprawl](https://historicsprawl.wordpress.com/), collect references [on Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/elipousson), and share photographs [on Flickr](http://flickr.com/photos/baltimoreheritage/). I also tweet [@elipousson](http://twitter.com/elipousson).

This site is a personal collection of research notes, projects, and presentations. I'm interested in historic preservation, open-source technology, networked nonprofits, social justice organizing, racial justice, public parks, community archives and sustainable transportation.

I volunteer as a board member of the [Rainbow Heritage Network](https://www.facebook.com/groups/439557382858786/), [Preservation Rightsizing Network](http://rightsizeplace.org), [Friends of Maryland's Olmsted Parks & Landscapes](http://olmstedmaryland.org), [Lakeland Community Heritage Project](http://lakelandchp.com/) and as an occasional organizer for the [Baltimore Family Bike Party](https://baltimorefamilybikeparty.wordpress.com).

Lately, I’ve been busy working on [Baltimore’s Civil Rights Landmarks](http://baltimoreheritage.github.io/civil-rights-heritage/), [Explore Baltimore Heritage](http://explore.baltimoreheritage.org), and a new [digital collections site for Baltimore Heritage](http://collection.baltimoreheritage.org).
