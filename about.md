Hello! My name is Eli Pousson. I am a historic preservation advocate and local historian in Baltimore, Maryland. I work for [Baltimore Heritage][1], occasionally blog at [Historic Sprawl][2], collect references [on Zotero][3], and share photographs [on Flickr][4]. I also tweet [@elipousson][5]. This site is a personal collection of research notes, projects, and presentations. I'm interested in historic preservation, open-source technology, networked nonprofits, social justice organizing, racial justice, public parks, community archives and sustainable transportation.

I volunteer as a board member of the [Rainbow Heritage Network][6], [Preservation Rightsizing Network][7], [Friends of Maryland's Olmsted Parks & Landscapes][8], [Lakeland Community Heritage Project][9] and as an occasional organizer for the [Baltimore Family Bike Party][10].  Lately, I’ve been busy working on [Baltimore’s Civil Rights Landmarks][11], [Explore Baltimore Heritage][12], and a new [digital collections site for Baltimore Heritage][13].
