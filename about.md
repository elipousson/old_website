Hello! My name is Eli Pousson. I am a graduate student in public health at Johns Hopkins University, a Bloomberg Fellow with [Baltimore Heritage](http://baltimoreheritage.org), and local historian in Baltimore, Maryland.

You can find some of my writing at [Historic Sprawl](https://historicsprawl.wordpress.com/), references [on Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/elipousson), and photographs [on Flickr](http://flickr.com/photos/baltimoreheritage/). I also tweet [@elipousson](http://twitter.com/elipousson) all about [311 and city services](https://twitter.com/hashtag/baltimore311), [picking up litter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/riseandpickuplitter), [vacant buildings](https://twitter.com/hashtag/vacants101), the [maintenance of civic spaces](https://twitter.com/hashtag/maintaincivicspaces), [family biking](https://twitter.com/hashtag/bikemorefamily), and [local history](https://twitter.com/hashtag/bmorehistoric).

This website is a personal collection of research notes, projects, and presentations. I'm interested in historic preservation, open-source technology, networked nonprofits, social justice organizing, racial justice, public parks, community archives and sustainable transportation.

Here are a few things I've worked on:

- [Explore Baltimore Heritage](http://explore.baltimoreheritage.org)
- [Baltimoreâ€™s Civil Rights Landmarks](http://baltimoreheritage.github.io/civil-rights-heritage/)
- [Baltimore Family Bike Party](https://baltimorefamilybikeparty.wordpress.com)
