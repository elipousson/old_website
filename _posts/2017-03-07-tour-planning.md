I met with a colleague over coffee at the new [Greenmount Coffee Lab](https://redemmas.org/gcl) to share advice on organizing a two hour walking tour program later this spring. When I got back to my desk, I thought the advice might be worth writing up into a quick tutorial.

In my experience, it takes about five hours to plan a two-hour-long walking tour program. It may take you more or less time depending on your background and how you approach the tour. The process I use works best for guided walking tours where you already have information about most or all of the tour sites. If you are planning a guided bike tours or bus tours or any self-guided tour, you may need to tweak this approach. If you are just getting started and do not know what tour sites might be appropriate to visit, you may need to [do more research](https://baltimoreheritage.org/resources/research-guide/) before you plan your walking tour.

## Making a map, schedule, and notes for a walking tour

1. Make a map of your tour route
  - Use [geojson.io](http://geojson.io/) (advanced) or [Google My Maps](https://mymaps.google.com/) (beginner)
  - Pick out stops where you want to spend a _longer_ amount of time
  - Make a route that connects all of the stops
  - For most tours, the route should end near the same location it begins
  - Fill in any additional stops where you can spend a _shorter_ amount of time
2. Make a schedule for your tour stops
  - Make a table (use Google Docs or Markdown)
  - Add columns to your table for:
    - the name of each stop
    - the duration of each stop (or separate columns for arrival and departure times)
    - brief notes
  - Fill in the schedule table:
    - List out each stop as a separate row
    - List out the amount of time to spend at each stop
    - Add in time for questions and discussion
    - Add in time for moving between stops
    - Add in any relevant notes for each stop
3. Write your tour notes
  - Create headings for each of the longer stop
  - Add sub-headings for shorter stops
  - Headings should typically include:
    - a related place name
    - a date of construction
    - an address
    - e.g. Old Town National Bank/Holiday Inn (1925) - 221 N. Gay Street
4. Try out the tour in advance:
  - Look out for issues with physical accessibility (e.g. stairs, steep grades, missing curb cuts, uneven pavement)
  - Look out for issues with physical comfort (e.g. loud noises, unpleasant smells)
  - Identify where the tour guide should stand and the participants should stand at each stop
  - Identify any amenities available along the route (e.g. bathrooms, coffee shops)
5. Revise the map, schedule, and notes as needed

### Additional topics in tour planning

I'm hoping to update this post with links and more information when I have more time:

- Researching walking tour sites
- Promoting a walking tour
- Keeping people engaged during a walking tour
- Revising and adapting walking tour notes
- Being kind and inclusive when communicating with tour participants

If you have any suggestions for existing resources on these topics or ideas for other topics a walking tour guide should address, please let me know [@elipousson](https://twitter.com/elipousson/) or share them on Twitter with the [#localpast hashtag](https://twitter.com/hashtag/localpast).
