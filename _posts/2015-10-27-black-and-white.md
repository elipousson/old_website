## Reading Memory in Black and White

This morning I read the first few chapters from Memory in Black and White by Paul A. Shackel. This material is background for the second round of revisions to my study of Baltimore's Confederate Monuments which I'll be presenting on Thursday, October 29, 2015.

## Race as a social/historical construct

>the conflict over racism and slavery has never really been resolved. In 1865, the Civil War was over and the issue of united states was settled. What the war did not accomplish was to change the racial ideologies that had developed in American culture over several centuries. (p.1)

>Several centuries later, the creation of the concept of race changed the way people percieved human differences. It imposed social meaning on physical variations between human groups and served as a basis for structuring the total society. It became prominent in the structuring of inequality in the American colonies, and it soon spread to other parts of the world when they too were colonized by western Europeans. (p.3)

- 1663: Maryland legislature declared that "Negroes were to serve 'Durante Vita,'" their entire lives
- 1681: Maryland act described mixed marriages as a "disgrace not only of the English butt also of many other Christian Nations." After 1691, marriages between enslaved people and freedmen became illegal.
- 1710s-1720s: Dramatic surge in racist legislation in Maryland, masked as a naturalizing ideology.
- 1728: Act passed "for the punishment of negro women, having bastard children by white men; and for as much as such copulation are as unnatural and inordinate as between white women and negroe men"

## Meaning, memory and power

>Traditions, meanings, and memories are invented, and they become legitimate through repetition or a process of formalization and ritualization characterized by reference to the past. By implying continuity with the past (and sometimes that is a matter of forgetting a past) or by reinventing a collective memory, these traditions reinforce values and behavior.

>Public memory is more a reflection of present political and social relations than a true reconstruction of the past. As present conditions change socially, politically, and ideologically, the collective memory of the past will also change.

>Public memory can be viewed as a tactical power that controls social settings. Competing groups battle ceaselessly to create and control the collective national memory of revered sacred sites and objects.

## History, memory and racism

>The exclusion of blacks from the national consciousness was an active process that was reinforced through written symbols, material symbols, and commemoration. While all blacks were American citizens from the time of the Reconstruction Amendments, it was close to a hundred years before they could gain inclusion in the collective memory of the United States.

Shackel notes changes in textbooks after mid-1960s; stamps after 1965 (notably the Black Heritage stamp series after 1981); National Black History Month in 1976; Martin Luther King Jr. Day in 1986; National Historic Landmark designations after 1970.

>Even though two peoples may share a common history, it does not mean that they shared a common experience. Material culture, be it in the form of statues, monuments, museums, artifacts, or landscapes, has some ascribed meaning (past and present) associated with it, and these meanings vary among individuals and interest groups. This material culture can be transformed into sacred objects when it servs the goals and needs of any group. Governments use objects and material culture to perpetuate a national heritage. ... Often, race is at the center of the struggles for the creation of power and meaning.
