I started by coming up with my own outline but quickly sought out resources from the Teaching Tolerance program. I took notes from The March Continues: Five Essential Practices for Teaching the Civil Rights Movement described as "a set of guiding principles for educators who want to improve upon the simplified King-and-Parks-centered narrative many state standards offer." I also tried to learn more about how Baltimore and Maryland typically teach the Civil Rights movement and what best practices the educators from Teaching Tolerance Recommend.

# How do Baltimore and Maryland teach the Civil Rights movement?

A March 2014 report by the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Teaching Tolerance Program—["Teaching the Movement 2014: The State of Civil Rights Education in the United States"](http://www.tolerance.org/sites/default/files/general/Teaching%20the%20Movement%202014_final_web_0.pdf) (PDF)—highlighted a major concern for many historians, activists and educators, writing:

>We remain concerned that students are likely to remem-ber only two names and four words about the civil rights movement: Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks and “I have a dream.”

In their review of "the breadth and depth of state standards and supports" across the nation they found only three states that earned an "A" grade and Maryland joined seven other states (Alabama, California, Florida, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma and Virginia) with a "B" grade between 50 percent and 60 percent. In this analysis, "a score of 100 percent would mean that a state’s standards and resources were outstanding in every area; 50 percent means that they are adequate."

In a separate list of ["Nine Notable State Resource Guides"](http://www.tolerance.org/book/nine-notable-state-resource-guides), a resource created by the Maryland State Department of Education and Reginald F. Lewis Museum of Maryland African American History & Culture is called out for praise, noting: "Several are movement-related. The lessons as a whole are excellent—most teachers could immediately use them in their classrooms." A few examples from [this larger collection](http://www.msde.maryland.gov/msde/divisions/instruction/rfl_museum_md.htm) include:

# What are the essential practices for teaching the movement?

1. Educate for empowerment.
2. Know how to talk about race.
3. Capture the unseen.
4. Resist telling a simple story.
5. Connect to the present.

# What are the essential content areas for teaching the movement?

1. Leaders: Students should learn that the civil rights movement was composed of many individuals and was not the initiative of any single person or small group of people.
2. Groups: Students should be able to identify major groups involved in the civil rights movement. They should explain the mission and accomplishments of each group, as well as trace the relationships among groups.
3. Events: Students should be able identify key events in the civil rights movement and place them in correct chronology. They should identify the causes and consequences of these events, linking key figures and organizations to each event.
4. Historical context: Students should be able to trace the roots of the civil rights movement to slavery and the Jim Crow era.
5. Opposition: Students should be able to identify opposition to the goals of the civil rights movement. They should examine the persistence of racism and be able to identify key figures and groups opposing the extension of civil rights.
6. Tactics: Students should be able to explain the advantages and disadvantages of tactics used at different times during the struggle for civil rights. They should identify and compare tactics and ideas such as boycotts, sit-ins, marches, going to jail, voter registration and Black Power.
7. Connections: Students should be able to make connections between the civil rights movement and other social movements in history, as well as to current events and social concerns. Students should be encouraged to apply the lessons of the civil rights movement when forming their own ideas about effective citizenship.
