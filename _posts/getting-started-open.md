# Background

[Guide to Open Licensing – Open Definition](http://opendefinition.org/guide/)

- **What is an open license?** A license is a document that specifies what can and cannot be done with a work (whether sound, text, image or multimedia). It grants permissions and states restrictions. Broadly speaking, an open license is one which grants permission to access, re-use and redistribute a work with few or no restrictions.
- **Why use an open license?** Works that are published without an explicit license are usually subject to the copyright laws of the jurisdiction they are published in by default. Open licenses enable creators to allow more freedom in what others can do with their works.
- **How can I apply an open license?** Applying an open license to a work can be very straightforward. The procedure may slightly vary depending on which license is selected.
