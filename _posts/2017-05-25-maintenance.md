As part of a new project on maintaining civic spaces, I am doing a literature review on building maintenance (including both homes and other kinds of properties). I'm especially interested in resources designed for use by facilities managers or property-owners but I'm also curious what I'll find in the scholarly literature on this topic. This bibliography covers what I've found so far but suggestions are welcome. I'll be sure to add links to notes or related information as the project progresses.
