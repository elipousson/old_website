As part of my work on the [Local Preservation School](http://localpreservation.github.io), I've been curious to seek out more online education experiences to learn more about what _I_ like and what I think might work well for the audiences we are hoping to reach. My neighbor and occasional collaborator Graham Coreil-Allen just shared a new six-week MOOC on Coursera that I'm really excited to try titled ["The Art of the MOOC: Merging Public Art and Experimental Education"](https://www.coursera.org/course/artofthemooc/).

Here is the course description:

>Can a MOOC be a work of art? New Yorkâ€™s public art organization, Creative Time, and Duke University believe it can. Designed by artist and Duke professor, Pedro Lasch, and co-taught with Creative Time chief curator, Nato Thompson, ART of the MOOC functions simultaneously as a socially-engaged public art form and a survey course on that very subject. Taking full advantage of the global scale yet intimate environment that only a MOOC can offer, this course merges traditional classroom practices with new technology and aesthetic experimentation.  Video lectures, complementary materials, and presentations by cross-national artists, curators, critics, and activists provide a formal and theoretical overview of the fundamental themes within socially-engaged public art. Interspersed with these lessons, students will contribute to the field by completing creative assignments and participating in collective art projects.  Online forums and opportunities to assemble outside of class will allow students to share their activities while developing critical thinking and discussion skills.  Through this hands-on, participatory approach, ART of the MOOC welcomes students as collaborators in an unprecedented expression of public art and education.

I just enrolled but like _many_ other MOOC users my track record for completion is poor. [Data collected by scholar Katy Jordan](http://www.katyjordan.com/MOOCproject.html) suggests that MOOC completion rates average around 15% although they can be as high as 40%.
