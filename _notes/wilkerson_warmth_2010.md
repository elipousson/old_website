## Notes after searching the index of "The Warmth of Other Suns" for Baltimore

- The Clansman (1905)
- The Birth of a Nation (1915)

Note: Look for the related example of waiters or staff at a downtown hotel in Baltimore (where the parking lot for Two Charles Center is now located on Saratoga Street) refusing to serve the author of The Clansman when it was touring as a play.

Kerner Report:

> About 74 percent of the rioters were brought up in the North... The typical rioter was a teenager or young adult, a lifelong resident of the city in which he rioted. [What the frustrated northerners] appeared to be seeking was fuller participation in the social order and the material benefits enjoyed by the majority of American citizens.

"What did they know of the frustration of the young people who had grown up in the mirage of equality but a whole different reality, in a densely packed world of drugs and gangs and disorder, with promises that seemed to have turned to dust?" (p. 409)

Charles S. Johnson, *Patterns of Negro Segregation* (1943): included an "entire section of racial ettiquette in traffic":

> When driving their own cars they were expected to maintain their role as Negros and in all cases to give whites the right-of-way... If there is any doubt about whose turn it is to make a move in traffic, the turn is assumed to be the white person's.
