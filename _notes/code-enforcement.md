Baltimore Code Enforcement

Information Is Just A Click Away

To  keep  residents  and  neighborhood  associations  informed  about  code  enforcement,  we  have  designed several  web-based  tools.  To  see  them,  visit  our  web site  www.baltimorehousing.org  and  click  on  “Housing Code Enforcement.”

How does Baltimore Housing look at the city?

- Healthy Neighborhoods
- CDCs

Properties:

- View violation notices: View  all  outstanding  notices,  by  neighborhood  or property.
- Track cases: Check the status of cases that have been forwarded for prosecution and read any court order deadlines.
- Search the Court Docket: Identify which properties are scheduled for court.

People:
- Find Your Housing Code Enforcement District Office and Superintendent: Look up contact information for your district office and superintendent  by  typing  an  address  into  our  search tool at baltimorehousing.org.

Development issues:

- Locate TEVO Properties: See  which  properties  are  included  in  the  TEVO  program (Targeted Enforcement toward Visible Outcomes). TEVO applies intensified code enforcement and legal action  to  the  owners  of  over  6,000  vacant  properties that lie on highly occupied blocks, where the rehab or sale of those properties will result in significant neighborhood improvements.

What should I do if I suspect work is being done in my neighborhood without a permit?

To check whether a permit exists on a specific property, visit our “Existing Permit Search”. You may anonymously report suspected unpermitted work by calling 311 or by submitting a request online after performing your search. One of our inspectors will follow-up on your request by visiting the worksite and determining whether an appropriate permit has been issued.
