Robert Kelly, 1978:

> Public history refers to the employment of historians and the historical method outside of academia.



**banking**: "a model where knowledge, or in our case history, is delivered as facts prepared by the experts to be accepted by the learners" (p. 7)

**problem-posing**:"heart" critical pedagogical practice; defined as "reflection and action upon the world in order to transform it." ([Paolo Freire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paulo_Freire))

Freire:

> The banking method emphasizes permanence and becomes reactionary; problem-posing education—which accepts neither a 'well-behaved' present nor a predetermined future—roots itself in the dynamic present and becomes revolutionary.

Freire cautioned the expert:

> not to consider himself or herself the proprietor of history... [or to become] the prisoner of a 'circle of certainty' [in which he or she claims to know all of the answers for everyone]

**free-choice learning** or **informal learning**: museums, zoos, and historic sites
