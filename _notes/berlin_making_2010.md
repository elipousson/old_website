The Contrapuntal Narrative

"Over the course of four centuries, the great migrations and the intervening periods of stability have created a culture in which physical movement has been both resisted and embraced and in which identification with place has been alternately espoused and disowned. If those on the move yearned for the stability of place, those chained to place—often literally so—wanted only to move."

Four passages:

1. *The* Middle Passage: From Africa to the New World
2. A second Middle Passage: From the seaboard to the interior ("black belt")
3. third passage: From the rural South to the urban North
4. fourth passage: global diaspora to American cities

p. 32

"The neck-snapping discontinuities between change and stasis have drawn black people to their past and invested that past with enormous weight, even as they wrestled again with an ever-changing present."

p. 34

"There have been many bridges between movement and place, linking the sense of what was lost to what was gained: rites of passage, aesthetics of form and color, styles of cooking and dressing, folktales and proverbs, even intonations of voice."

**Idea:** Berlin highlights music as a key bridge. This would be a good opportunity to incorporate material from Spotify.

"The emergence of the plantation system changed the nature of slavery throughout the Atlantic"

The expansion of plantation agriculture with enslaved African labor into the Americas began in the sixteenth century.

"Within a century, slavery had become synonymous with people of African descent in the minds of many Europeans;"

English clergyman in 1680:

> these two words, Negro and Slave ... [had] ... by custom grown Homogenous and convertible."

"Blackness took on a new meaning."

p. 55-56

Dutch trader from the coast of Africa, early nineteenth century:

> Not a few in our country fondly imagine the Parents here sell their Children Men their Wives and one Brother the other. But those who think so deceive themselves

p. 56

"Captives did not go quietly. Resistance that began at the point of capture continued as the enslaved marched to the coast."

p. 57

"A fortunate few" escaped from the "coastal enclaves"

"Most captives faced the nigthmarish transatlantic crossing. The depths of human misery and the astounding death toll of men and women packed in the stinking hulls shamed the most hard-hearted. Slave traders themselves testified to the deleterious effects of the trade."

p. 66

"About one in ten slave ships faced some kind of unrest, and no slave trader—whether captains or crew—lived without fear of revolt."
