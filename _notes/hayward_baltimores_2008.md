"Several factors were working together to bring so many free blacks to the city. Maryland's agricultural economy was gradually changing from the growing of labor-intensive tobacco to the less demanding cultivation of wheat. More and more Maryland farmers found it an econmic burden to maintain large families of slaves and many, like the Lloyd family, sent slaves elsewhere to work for wages. Others, influenced by the vocal abolitionist messages of the state's Quakers and Methodists, decided on long-term manumissions instead of selling slaves south."

"Methodist  ministers denounced slavery from the pulpit and proclaimed it a 'great evil' at the 1796 General Conference held in Baltimore. The fact that a well-known black orator, ['Black Harry' Hosier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Hosier), traveled and preached with such early Methodist leaders as Francis Asbury and Thomas Coke attracted many slaves and free blacks to the new faith. ... By 1800, black worshippers accounted for more than 35 percent of the city's Methodists; by 1815 their numbers had risen to half of all congregants."
