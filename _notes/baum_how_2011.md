### Desegregating Schools in 1954



p. 155

- late 1940s: Carl Murphy and Juanita Jackson Mitchell began pushing to desegregate Baltimore public schools
- early 1950s: "small group of black leaders organized by Murphy and Mitchell began strategizing to push the school board to integrate as soon as the Court rules"
- June 3, 1954: Baltimore school board, under leadership of new president Walter Sondheim, voted "unanimoiusly to end school segregation"
- June 10, 1954: adopted policy proposal by Superintendent John FIscher to continue open-enrollment policy, "except that the race of the pupil shall not be a consideration"



Baum writes, "...desegregation would be voluntary. The board refused to assign students and placed responsibility for racial mixing on families... Explicitly, it would not discriminate against black children; implicitly, neither would it act on their behalf. ... The NAACP took credit for board action and adoption of free choice..."

Three conditions limited choices for students:

1. Segregated "colored school buildings were dilapidated, dangerous, outmoded, and poorly equipped." Parents would not "choose such schools."


2. Discrimination left fewer black teachers with advanced training (most studied at from Coppin Teachers College"an unaccredited, segregated noraml school with meager facilities and few faculty with graduate degrees") and segregated black teachers at colored schools. (p. 156)
3. Deeply segregated housing likely made many parents "uncomfortable" sending their children to a school associated with another race.

Enrollment after 1954 "showed two trends":

- "slowly growing but moderate racial mixing in the schools"
- "transition from a majority white to a majority black school district"

Table uses the "prevailing definition" of integrated: "including at least 10 percent of students from each race"

- 1963: 28 Parents, a group of white and black parents, presented a report to the school board describing three practices maintaining *de facto* segregation.
  - "board located new schools in racially homogenous neighborhoods... sites made segregation likely"
  - limiting "overcrowded schools" to neighborhood children reinforced existing patterns of housing segregation
  - administrators: "Some white principals encouraged white parents to transfer their children out when black enrollment grew. Some principals rejects black transfer applications to predominantly white schools."



"Within racially mixed schools, ability tracking put black and white students in separate programs. After a decade of legal segregation, most children attended class with majorities of their own race... By the time the board ended practices that limited choices, the desegregation policy had a ten-year history associated in the public mind with continuing segregation."

1967 mayoral campaign elected City Council President Thomas D'Alesandro III, as Mayor; he had "defended busing to relieve overcrowding and to remove children from deficient schools and proposed replacing obsolete schools and building educational parks to draw students from across the region."
