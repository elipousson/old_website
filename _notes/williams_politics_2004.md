July 1966, Afro American newspaper writes that Mothers Rescuers "statements and activism symbolized":

>the new mood creeping slowly through the black ghetto of Baltimore like sunlight at an early dawn—a mood that demands rights and respect and a chance for a decent life as the natural birthright of all.

"By 1968, more than half of Baltimore's public housing population, which was 81 percent black, received public assistance."

"As they pushed for citizenship and economic self-sufficiency, low-income, urban black women exanded the vision of the black freedom and women's liberation struggles and contested state oppression. Their primary focus extended beyond the traditional civil rights issues of public accomodations, the vote, and legislative equality. Like civil rights activists Ella Baker, Fannie Lou Hamer, and Gloria Richardson, poor black women focused on questions of economics, survival and dignity."

p. 198

"The uprisings revealed poor people's frustration and fear and their desires to attack exploitation and obtain consumer goods."

February 1968, Walter Lively warned "white decisions makers that they had to":

> give colored citizens a stake in what America is before ghetto dwellers could see a chance to accomplish their goals without violence.

Lively, "in the midst of the rebellions... argued that the 'completely spontaneous' urban uprisings indicated"

> that an overwhelming portion of the black community of this city do not want the white man to continue his economic colonization of our people.
