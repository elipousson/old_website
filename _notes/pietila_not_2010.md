Arthur P. Gorman, 1889:

> This govermnent was made by white men and shall be ruled by white men as long as the republic lasts.

p. 25

W. Ashbie Hawkins following City Council passage of the residential segregation law

>The courts are open and to them we should go. The citadel of our rights is in the courts, but courts are not self-acting institutions. They are formed and maintained for our protection, but their protection in private matters is not wholly vouchsafed us unless we appeal to them.

Colonel Curtis W. Jacobs, Eastern Shore delegate to the Maryland General Assembly, proposed "reenslavement of all free blacks" (late rejected by voters in referendum):

> Free-Negroism is an excresence, a blight, a mildew, a fungus—hanging on to and corrupting the social and moral eleemnts of our people in Maryland. ... I would have all negroes to be slaves in order that all whites be free.

p. 26

1895 election, Republicans overturned Democratic Party victory, Pietila for violent election fraud to scare black voters away from the polls.

p. 27

Dr. George Wellington Bryant hired in 1896 by Republican administration to "supervise the city's first contingent of black municipal workers—garbage men, janitors, and messengers" hired the same year. Bryant was later sentenced to "six months in prison for stealing from the city and demaning kick backs from his hires"

Pietila cites example of Everett J. Waring and failure of the Lexington Savings Bank as a "scandal" exploited by the Democrats in their white supremacist campaign to retake city government.

p. 28

Edwin Warfield, elected as Governor in 1903

> This election is a content for the supremacy of the white race in Maryand. I am not willing that an ignorant, prejudiced, irresponsible, non-taxpaying negro's vote shall outweigh a vote cast by an intelligent, educated white man. The founders of this naton, when laying the cornerstone of our country, never intended any such montrous perversion of the principle of manhood suffrage and of that principle that declared the right of the majority to rile.

p. 29

Rev. Palestine S. Henry (messenger at U.S. Fidelity and Guaranty Company) attended June 1913 meeting on black Methodist Episcopal preachers' meeting; read a poem (later "widely circulated as a printed leaflet"):

> Come, O come thou great anounted,
>
> Thou for us who was appointed;
>
> Save us in our tribulation
>
> From this hateful Segregation
>
> We never engage in insurrection
>
> But have been loyal to perfection.
>
> We shed out blood to save the nation,
>
> And now being paid for Segregation.

p. 209

Dale Anderson, Baltimore County Executive, 1969:

> There are no walls around Baltimore County

1955-1965: 82 industrial firms left Baltimore City; 65 of 82 (79.27%) moved to Baltimore County

p. 226

"Ever since the first zoning law was enacted in 1949, the county had confined rowhouses and high-density apartments mostly to one geographical area, the eas-end communities of Dundal and Essex-Middle River."

p.228-229

Spiro Agnew "ousted" the chairman of the Balimore County Community Relations Commission after he "endorsed open housing" saying he "confused civil equality with social acceptance"

Agnew:

>Open occupancy legislation, the attempted crashing of private membership clubs, unlawful trespassing and unlawful demonstrating, violate the civil rights of others just as clearly as segrgeation violates the civil rights of the Negro. I take a strong position that it is wrong to tell the owner of a private dwelling place, be it single family or multiple unit, that he must offer it for rent or sale to anyone with whom he does not wish to do business. This applies whether or not he is biased and applies regardless of what his bias may embrace. If he dislikes Greeks he should not have to deal with Greeks, and the government that infringes upon his discretion in this rsspect abrogates his freedom of selection, and disregards the intent of the Constitution of the United States.

p. 229-230

Urban renewal plans for East Towson first approved by Baltimore County City Council in 1960; 1964 referendum defeated by voters (following "agitation, coordinated by the extreme right-wing John Birch Society")

p. 231

"Without access to federal funds, Anderson embarked on a rump renewal program for Towson.... a bypass road was constructed flanked by government and commercial offices. The end result was the same: East Towson's black community shrank: Another pocket of African Americans, disappeared alogether, becoming the site of a high school, police and fire department headquarters, and, eventually, the county jail. In Catonsville, snack shacks and no fewer than ten gasoline stations replaced black homes at Baltimor National Pike and the Beltway"

County used zoning and "decimated at least twenty old African-American settlements throughout the county."

p. 234

Civil Rights Commission hearings held in 1970 at the Social Security Administration headquarters in Woodlawn

1972: SSA announcement expansion plan to move 2,800 workers (mostly African American) to Woodlawn.

Anderson opposed:

> not one house in that bracket will pay enough taxes to educate one child, and how many of those people coming in here are going to have one child or more?

p. 235

1972: Anderson eliminated 4 key positions in the Baltimore County Planning Department (in the midst of a "forward-looking plan to guide the county's long-term growth").

p. 236

Department director Goerge Gavrelis "resigned in protest"; Anderson fired co-drector (?) Leslie Graef

A few months later, Anderson "ordered real estate agents to report all sales to blacks to the police. He said he was acting at the request of the Real Estate Board."

A representative Civil Rights Commission later responded that Anderson's intention was to:

> clearly intimidate rather than help the potential black buyer in the county.
