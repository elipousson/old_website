1972: Anderson eliminated 4 key positions in the Baltimore County Planning Department (in the midst of a "forward-looking plan to guide the county's long-term growth").

p. 236

Department director Goerge Gavrelis "resigned in protest"; Anderson fired co-drector (?) Leslie Graef

A few months later, Anderson "ordered real estate agents to report all sales to blacks to the police. He said he was acting at the request of the Real Estate Board."

A representative Civil Rights Commission later responded that Anderson's intention was to:

> clearly intimidate rather than help the potential black buyer in the county.
